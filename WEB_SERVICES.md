When all major platforms could access the Web using Web browsers, `different platforms couldn't interact`. For these platforms to work together, `Web-applications were developed`.
Web-applications are simply applications that `run on the web`. These are `built around the Web browser standards` and `can be used by any browser` on any platform.
```
- By using Web services, your application can publish its function or message to the rest of the world.
- Web services use XML to code and to decode data, and SOAP to transport it (using open protocols).
